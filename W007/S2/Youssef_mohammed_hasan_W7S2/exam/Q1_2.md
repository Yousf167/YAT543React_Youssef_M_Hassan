# Question 1
1. `<ol>` elements are used when we want to make a list with no importance to ordering. `<ul>` is used to make lists that signify an order of steps or heirarchy of precedence 

2. the `id` attribute is used to give an HTML element a unique identifier which is then selected in CSS for styling or in JS for DOM manipulation

3. The difference is that:\
      a. 20px is an absulute measurment\
      b. 2 is relative to font size; meaning that the line height is double the font size

4. the defualt HTML font size

5. 
|  | let | const | var |
|---| ----|-------|------ |
| function  | declares a block-scoped variable | declares a block-scoped constant | declares a function-scoped variable |
| mutability | mutable | immutable | mutable
| general comparison | let is more modern and allows for more defined behaviours. allowing for the control of variables within the scope of declaration without the unpredictability of `var` | constants that get declared cannot be reassigned, they need to be assigned at declaration | var is sometimes unpredictable due to the `var` variable being hoisted to the top of the file. meaning that if a `var` is declared after being console.log()-ed it would still work. `var` is not an industry or a modern standard anymore and should not be used|


# Question 2
```javascript
for(let i = 1; i <= 4; i++>){
      if(i % 2 == 0){
            console.log(i)
      }
}
```
for each iteration, the following occurs:
* i = 1: nothing
* i = 2: `console.log(2)`
* i = 3: nothing
* i = 4: `console.log(4)`

final output:

            2
            4


```javascript
console.log('1' -- 1) // 2
console.log("1" + 1) // 2
console.log(true + 0 > false + true) 
// 1 + 0 > 0 + 1 => false
```

```javascript
function greeting(){
      return "welcome all"
}
console.log(typeof(greeting())) //string
```
